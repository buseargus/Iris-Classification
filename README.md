# Iris-Classification

The primary aim of the program is to find out which of the three different species a flower that we know is a lily plant belongs to, using the KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) method.
  - Dataset consists of 150 data, including 4 characteristics of flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and information about what type they are. 
  - The K-Nearest Neighbor method is performed by measuring the distance between two flowers and detecting the k flowers with the smallest distance (k is entered by the user).
